Web Programming. Final project.

Java 8 + Spring MVC + Spring JPA + Hibernate + Tomcat + MySQL + Thymeleaf. Isn't that nice? :)

## how to run:

1) Install Apache Maven 3 and Oracle JDK or OpenJDK 8. Lower versions won't work and I will not support them anyhow.

2) In this folder, go to your command prompt or terminal and type *mvn spring-boot:run*. Wait about 10 seconds after Maven installs the dependencies.

3) Go to localhost:8080 as soon as you can to see the result

## how to contribute:

I do not accept any contribution right row due the nature of a homework ;)
